- visit http://localhost:3000/social to visit list of most current tweets 
Unfortunately I cannot use Search Tweets endpoint because I must pay. 

- run "node db-geocode.js" to insert vacations into db WITH "location" inserted
- visit "http://localhost:3000/vacations-map" to see a google map with red stickers to the location
Unfortunately I am not paying this either so can't check
